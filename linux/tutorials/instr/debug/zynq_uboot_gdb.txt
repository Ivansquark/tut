target remote localhost:3000


With U-Boot relocation, symbols are more difficult to load, see doc/README.arm-relocation for details.

If you connect GDB on running target, you can load the debug symbols:

    Before relocation with "symbol-file" command:

 symbol-file u-boot

    After relocation with "add-symbol-file" command to relocate the symbol with the code offset = gd->relocaddr:

        for STM32MP1 series (AARCH32)

 symbol-file u-boot                            --> only for "gd_t" definition
 set $offset = ((gd_t *)$r9)->relocaddr        --> get relocation offset, gd in r9 register
 symbol-file                                   --> clear previous symbol
 add-symbol-file u-boot $offset

        for STM32MP2 series (AARCH64)

 symbol-file u-boot                            --> only for "gd_t" definition
 set $offset = ((gd_t *)$x18)->relocaddr       --> get relocation offset, gd in x18 register
 symbol-file                                   --> clear previous symbol
 add-symbol-file u-boot $offset
