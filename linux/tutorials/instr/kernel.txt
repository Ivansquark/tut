vmlinux
vmlinux" is a file which is created in the process of building kernel file from
the sources. It is saved in ELF format. Then it can be used for debugging purposes
using some debugger (i.e. GDB). It is not used for booting the systems

arch/arm64/boot
Basing on this "vmlinux" ELF file there are created other files - like "Image".
"Image" is a file which consists of some parts of vmlinux plus some boot code and
this boot code is then used by bootloaders to start the kernel on the system.
